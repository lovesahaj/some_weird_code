# Question 1

* 2-d list length -> N
* max length of sublist -> P
* number of queries -> Q

## Two parts to the problem
1. Lists (2D list)
2. Queries

## for every query

find a list in the sublist that has the same length of elements and the same elements present [does this mean the list are the same?? what if we have duplicate but the length remains the same and the elements remains same as well]

if the list is not present add the list otherwise do nothing.

after every query print the list.
